# dotfiles

These are Filip Godlewski's dotfiles that use the technique presented here: [best way to store dotfiles](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

## Getting Started

First of all, instructions below are prepared for MacOS, as this is my daily work machine. Follow the instructions.

### Prerequisites



### Installing

The commands below are required to run before you clone this repository. It is required to understand what is going on here so you don't run into problems.

```sh
echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore
git clone --bare https://github.com/filipgodlewski/dotfiles.git $HOME/.cfg
alias cfg='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
cfg checkout
```

If `cfg checkout` fails, simply backup or delete files listed that stop the process, then repeat `cfg checkout` and proceed:

```sh
cfg config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

## Under construction

Below are the 5 latest done tasks and all to dos that I have to finish, because why not!

### To dos

- [ ] rewrite brew.sh from old-dotfiles so that it works in this new environment
- [ ] add instructions for oh-my-zsh (and/or add dotfiles if appropriate)
- [ ] find a way to store vs code files (especially for extensions). Consider adding settings.json
- [ ] add pip requirements
- [ ] add macos preferences config file [inspired by this file](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles/blob/master/macos)
- [ ] add script to update & upgrade all submodules, brew, npm, yarn etc.

### Done

- [x] add vim plugins directory
- [x] delete backups and swaps from vim
- [x] find a way to easily install vim plugin repos

The whole workflow was inspired by this great [YouTube video by DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM).

This is how I got into git submodules to handle vim plugins: [Using the Vim 8 Package Manager](https://dvonrohr.com/2016/12/11/vim-package-manager/)

This dotfile repository has very interesting ideas. Definitely worth some reading! [webpro dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)
