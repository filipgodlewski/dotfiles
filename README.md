# dotfiles

MK1 was my first attempt, highly unorganized. It was soon replaced by:

MK2, which was based on the technique presented here:
[best way to store dotfiles](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

MK3 - the **current** one. Including gnu stow,
after watching [ThePrimeagen's stow tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUllCAGs3c)

Finally, **restart terminal**.

## Inspiration

The whole workflow was inspired by this great [YouTube video by DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM).

This is how I got into git submodules to handle vim plugins:
[Using the Vim 8 Package Manager](https://dvonrohr.com/2016/12/11/vim-package-manager/)

This dotfile repository has very interesting ideas. Definitely worth some reading!
[webpro dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)

Some things I borrowed are from
[idcrook/i-dotfiles](https://github.com/idcrook/i-dotfiles) - try it out!

The idea for `dotfiles` and `packages` applications came from [webpro/dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles).

I also got the idea of `make` command from [Makefile for your dotfiles](https://polothy.github.io/post/2018-10-09-makefile-dotfiles/)
