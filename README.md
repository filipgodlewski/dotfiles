# dotfiles

These are Filip Godlewski's dotfiles that use the technique presented here: [best way to store dotfiles](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

## Getting Started

First of all, instructions below are prepared for MacOS, as this is my daily work machine. Follow the instructions.

### Prerequisites

This setup requires:

- `curl`: to download some stuff, like homebrew
- `git`: to clone the repo
- `homebrew`: to install all the stuff that I use
- `vim`: , my main editor, at least v.8
- `zsh`: my main shell

### Installing

The commands below are required to run before you clone this repository. It is required to understand what is going on here so you don't run into problems.

```sh
echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore
git clone --bare https://github.com/filipgodlewski/dotfiles.git $HOME/.cfg
alias cfg='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
cfg checkout
```

If `cfg checkout` fails, simply backup or delete files listed that stop the process, then repeat `cfg checkout` and proceed:

```sh
cfg config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

`coc.nvim` will require additional step:
```sh
cd <path_to_submodule>/coc.nvim
cfg clean -xfd
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Deleting submodules

```sh
cfg submodule deinit <path_to_submodule>
cfg rm <path_to_submodule>
cfg commit
rf <path_to_submodule>
# `rf` is an alias for `rm -rf`
```

## Under construction

Below are the 5 latest done tasks and all to dos that I have to finish, because why not!

### To dos

- [ ] clean up brew_list, brew_cask_list, pip_list files from the unnecessary stuff.
- [ ] add macos preferences config file [inspired by this file](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles/blob/master/macos)
- [ ] add autoload functions to zsh so that I can easily see them [as seen here.](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/07/moving-to-zsh-part-4-aliases-and-functions/)
- [ ] add vscode files (especially for extensions)

### Done

- [x] add brew requirements
- [x] add pip requirements
- [x] add fonts
- [x] delete ctags
- [x] add script to update & upgrade all submodules, brew, npm, yarn etc. and clean the whole mac from trash

## Acknowledgement

The whole workflow was inspired by this great [YouTube video by DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM).

This is how I got into git submodules to handle vim plugins: [Using the Vim 8 Package Manager](https://dvonrohr.com/2016/12/11/vim-package-manager/)

This dotfile repository has very interesting ideas. Definitely worth some reading! [webpro dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)
