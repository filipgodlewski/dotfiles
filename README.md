# dotfiles

MK1 was my first attempt, highly unorganized. It was soon replaced by:

MK2, which was based on the technique presented here: [best way to store dotfiles](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

**CURRENT**

MK3 - the current one. Including gnu stow, after watching [ThePrimeagen's stow tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUllCAGs3c)

## About

First of all, instructions below are prepared for MacOS, as this is my daily work machine. Follow the instructions if that fits your needs.

### install

**!!IMPORTANT!!**

Before the script, sign in to *Mac App Store*!

```sh
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/filipgodlewski/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
make -s install  # `-s` will suppress all commands from being echoed
```

Finally, **restart terminal**. You should also gain access to `dot` command. 

`dot` is my personal dotfiles manager.
Type `dot` to get more help on how to use it. Visit [dot's repository](https://github.com/filipgodlewski/dot) to find out more about it.

### Uninstall

```sh
# Make sure you killed your tmux session first, otherwise it will fail
cd ~/dotfiles
make -s uninstall
```

## Inspiration

The whole workflow was inspired by this great [YouTube video by DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM).

This is how I got into git submodules to handle vim plugins: [Using the Vim 8 Package Manager](https://dvonrohr.com/2016/12/11/vim-package-manager/)

This dotfile repository has very interesting ideas. Definitely worth some reading! [webpro dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)

Some things I borrowed are from [idcrook/i-dotfiles](https://github.com/idcrook/i-dotfiles) - try it out!

The idea for `dotfiles` and `packages` applications came from [webpro/dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles).

I also got the idea of `make` command from [Makefile for your dotfiles](https://polothy.github.io/post/2018-10-09-makefile-dotfiles/)
